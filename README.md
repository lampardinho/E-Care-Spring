1	Introduction
This document is the template for a User Interface Concept Proposal (UICP). It should be used by Symbian Foundation community members to describe the user interface of their software contribution (complement the Development Proposal) or for suggesting user interface improvements, if the contribution is significant enough for the User Interface council to engage. See Appendix for typical cases when to provide a User Interface Concept Proposal. After the proposal has been processed by the User Interface council there is no need for the contributor to maintain it.
1.1	Template Instructions
Remove the introduction chapter and replace italic help text with real content before submitting the development proposal.

Guidance
User Interface Concept proposal name
•	a short unique phrase that describes the substance and context of the proposal
•	avoid a title that gives little clue as to the proposal’s content – e.g. “WLAN Phase 2”.
Status
•	should be one of: Draft / Proposed / Accepted / Rejected

Development Proposal ID is unique ID provided by the Foundation. Shall only be provided the User Interface Concept Proposal is filed along with a correspoinding Development Proposal.
3	User Interface Concept Proposal
3.1	Description
Describe in a few paragraphs the proposed changes to the user interface or user interface platform.
3.2	Benefits
Describe in a few paragraphs how this proposal improves the competitiveness of the Foundation Platform in terms of user interface. What usability problem is being addressed? What is the current situation? How will the end user benefit?
Does the proposal contravene or improve an existing standard of interaction and thus require new or additional guideline documentation? Add any justification of need for changes in the User Interface Style Guides.
3.3	Benchmark
Add any references to similar user interface design solutions on competing platforms, on PC or on the Internet.
3.4	Visualize
Add screenshots or mock-ups of the proposed user interface design based on use cases broken down into tasks.
Pictures and drawings can be added from an application of your choice.
3.5	Localization
3.5.1	Languages
What is the language of the solution?
Do you plan to implement additional localization for the proposal?
Which language variants are contributed?
3.5.2	User feedback elements
Does the solution require icons, haptics, or audio feedback not currently available in the platform?
Do you plan to provide the additional material needed?
3.5.3	Hardware/key mapping
Does the solution require remapping of platform-specified minimum hardware?
3.6	Dependencies
List any dependencies to other User Interface Concept Proposals or planned/ongoing development of enablers, e.g. hardware buttons, sensors, radios, specific screen technologies, or other enablers that may or may not be present on specific hardware.
3.7	Exclusions
Summarise work outside the proposal that would be required in order for the features to be productised and benefits fully realised (usability studies for certain use cases, additional localization work etc.)

5.1	When to Provide a User Interface Concept Proposal
User Interface Concept Proposal must be provided for
•	any Development Proposal judged by the FRC to impact the user interface in a substantial way, such as proposals of completely new applications, or major updates to existing applications such as layout changes, navigation or localization changes.
•	any suggestion for innovative user interface improvements where changes to User Interface Style Guides and design patterns are required, such as bigger changes to list handling, general navigation and text input

Consider providing a User Interface Concept Proposal for
•	Features that are published on Release and Technology Domain roadmaps
•	Changes that have significant business value, i.e. are worth printing on the product spec
o	To enable community members product planning to better understand and prepare for the feature
•	Features that are interesting to the wider community
o	To enable community to engage and contribute; complement the feature and create business around it
•	Features where the contributor would benefit from the community interaction
o	Getting contributions, integration to different types of devices, early adopter feedback
•	Changes to the Foundation UI framework
5.2	Criteria for the User Interface Concept Proposal review process
This section provides useful information on how to prepare a User Interface Concept Proposal and what to consider in order to making it more successful in the acceptance process. Added are both acceptance and rejection criteria’s.
5.2.1	Criteria for rejection
A User Interface Concept Proposal is likely to be rejected if:
•	The User Interface Concept Proposal potentially infringes legal copyright and patents owned by a company not a member of the Symbian Foundation (e.g. unacceptable / unnecessary imitation of other products, limitation of trademark or logos of other companies iconography or graphics)
•	The User Interface Concept Proposal makes use of User's personal data and does not demonstrate what methods will be employed to ensure it is protected
•	The User Interface Concept Proposal differs in scope of the corresponding, approved development proposal
–	The UI Council may conditionally approve a User Interface Concept Proposal that differs in agreed scope given the condition that the FRC agrees to the new scope. The FRC shall in these cases be notified in order for the adequate proposal content to be discussed and approved.
•	The User Interface Concept Proposal interaction paradigm is significantly different and threatens consistency of the Symbian Foundation user interface (e.g. violates more than one aspect of the guidelines to the point that it is basically unusable, fundamentally not authored for a mobile environment or the Symbian Founcation Platform, etc).
–	This criteria is to prevent external inconsistency developing within the Symbian Foundation Platform user interface between different applications. It is important that this criteria is not confused with a limitation in acceptance of contributions of new interactions styles and paradigms that will drive innovation into the foundations user experience.
•	The User Interface Concept Proposal is not interoperable to the degree that it interferes with or disables any other functionality on the phone.
5.2.2	Criteria for approval
A User Interface Concept Proposal is likely to be approved if it is:
•	Easy to understand according to the norm and standards of the target user population
•	Easy to use
•	Efficient to use
•	Follows the Symbian Foundation User Interface Style Guides where appropriate. (e.g. does not contain inadequate or inconsistent use of components)
•	The Symbian Foundation design philosophy is met
•	The User Interface Concept Proposal is supported with research into user wants and needs
•	The User Interface Concept Proposal follow industrial usability standards (e.g. ISO9241 etc. Ref: http://www.usabilitypartners.se/usability/standards.shtml)

Additional criteria for new controls or interaction styles
•	the User Interface Concept Proposal demonstrate sustainability
•	the User Interface Concept Proposal demonstrate extensibility of future scope through road mapping or trend forecasting
•	the User Interface Concept Proposal is an enabler that lays down a foundation for future innovation
